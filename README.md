# RSVP Program

Welcome to **RSVP** (Rapid Serial Visual Presentation)! This program allows users to read text files by displaying words or chunks of words one at a time in the terminal at a user-defined speed. Designed for both programmers and non-programmers, RSVP provides an efficient way to speed-read and manage text content.

## üìã Current Features

- **Word-by-Word Display**: Displays words sequentially in the terminal.
- **Customisable Speed**: Adjust the speed (words per minute) in real time using keyboard shortcuts.
- **Chunk Size Control**: Choose how many words to display at a time.
- **Progress Tracking**: Shows the number of words read and the total word count.
- **Persistent Preferences**: Saves speed and chunk size settings for future sessions.
- **Intuitive Controls**: Use keyboard shortcuts for seamless navigation:
  - `[Q]` to quit
  - `[Space]` to pause or resume
  - `[‚Üë]`/`[‚Üì]` to increase or decrease speed by 10 WPM
  - `[PgUp]`/`[PgDn]` to adjust speed by 100 WPM
  - `[1-9]` to set chunk size
  - `[‚Üê]`/`[‚Üí]` to skip backward or forward by 5 words
  - `[L]` to load a new file
  - `[P]` to open preferences
  - `[B]` to bookmark the current position
